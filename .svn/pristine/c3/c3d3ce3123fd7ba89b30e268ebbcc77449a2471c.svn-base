    # This script downloads climate data available from January 1981 through yesterday at a 4k resolution.

    # The data is broken into 3 categories: early, provisional, and stable.
    # early = this months data: climatologically-aided interpolation is used to fill in missing data points
    # provisional = prior 6 months data: quality is better than early, but refinements are still being made
    # stable = data older than 6 months: by this point no more changes should be made to the data
    # For more info on when PRISM data is updated see: http://prism.nacse.org/calendar/


    # The script downloads zip files to prism_path: which is defined in config.yml
    # It then unzips and imports the bil file into either the tmin_<year> or tmax_<year> table in the climate db
    # as well as putting an entry in the mosaic table for geoserver to create a coverage from.
    # This script can be ran multiple times, inserting new rows for new data
    # and overwriting old rows for data we already retrieved. For example if we have provisional data for a specific
    # day already and the script is reran when stable data has become available then the provisional data will be
    # replaced with the stable data. All early and provisional data gets overwritten everytime the script is ran
    # so that we always have the most recent data. We never try to reretrieve stable data unless the local zip files
    # are deleted for the corresponding days.
    # Look in config.yml to specify prism_path: <loc where zip files are downloaded> and database connection variables.
    # We don't delete the zip files in prism_path:

    # Specify the climate elements you want to download as well as the date range to download those elements for:
